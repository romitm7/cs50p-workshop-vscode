# CS50P Workshop: VS Code
Workshop for students taking CS50P at [Aryaloka](https://www.aryalokaeducation.com/courses/cs50x-python/) (CS50x Python at Aryaloka): unleashing the power of VS Code.

⚡ VSCode is the most loved and advanced IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) we have today. You will for sure use it later when you work out in the industry. 

So far you have only seen a glimpse of what it can do in the regular CS50 problem set solving. In this lecture (not included in this repo) and workshop you will learn more in depth: fuzzy open, command palate, installing powerful and fun extensions, keyboard shortcuts, change settings, installing cool themes.

🧩 Especially we will look at useful extensions that helps you on your coding journey.



## Steps

**First step**: click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repo, to create your own version of this repo. Then you can use the below check-list to complete the tasks.

*Then in your own fork:* Check off the tasks below as you complete them by putting an `x` in the square brackets like `- [x]`:
- [ ] Open VS Code as usual at [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/)

- [ ] Try out these keyboard shortcuts:
    * `F2`: rename variable/function in all places.
    * `ctrl+p`: open a file quickly with fuzzy find. Type parts of a name like `bank` just `door`.
    * `ctrl+shift+p`: open command palette. Try out some commands like "Format Document" or "New File".
    * `ctrl+\``: toggle between editor and terminal.
    * `ctrl+/`: comment out current or with mouse selected lines.
    * `Paste in terminal: `ctrl+v` is not working. Instead press one of the keyboard combinations:
        * `ctrl+shift+v`
        * `shift+insert`
        * `right click mouse` in the terminal input line.
    * `ctrl+click` on a function name or variable to take you to the definition of it.
    * Auto-completion:
        * VSCode editor: type parts of variable or function name and press `ctrl+space`
        * Terminal: type parts of file and then press `<tab>` like `$ python ba<tab>` to complete `bank.py` if there is such file in current directory.

- [ ] Enable indentation guides in your editor to avoid indentation mistakes.
    * VSCode: open settings with: ctrl+,
    * Paste in the search field "editor.guides.indentation"
    * Switch to the tab "Workspace"
    * Check ✔ the box for "Editor > Guides: Indentation"
    * Now you will have indentation guides in your code editor.

-   Folder organization.

-   To make it easier for you to find old solutions, create a directory for each week. However, this makes for longer names to type on the keyboard like $ cd 0_functions_variables/playback. Thus I recommend: once you've completed a full week, then create a new directory for that week and drag-and-drop the problem set in to that directory.

-   Create folders like:

-   0_functions_variables

-   1_conditionals

-   2_loops

-   3_exceptions

-   4_libraries

-   5_unit_tests

-   6_file_io

-   7_regular_expressions

-   8_object-oriented_programming

-   VSCode desktop version.

-   If you code on your own computer, you can benefits from a bit more speed and robustness by [downloading](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) VSCode desktop version. It works exactly the same as the web version, but a bit better experience.

-   To use VSCode desktop instead of web, when you go to [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) instead of pressing the "Log In" button press the down arrow andthen "Open in VS Code Desktop".
